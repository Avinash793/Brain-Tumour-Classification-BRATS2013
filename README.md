# Brain-Tumour-Classification-BRATS2013
This repo contains implementation of various DL models for Brain Tumour Classification on BRATS-2013 Datasets. 
Done experiments with Batch Normaliation, Dropout, Weighted loss function to get final DL models which performed very good. 
Please check for final Results and summary of the experiments in the report attached with this repo.
